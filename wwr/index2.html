        <a class = 'hint'>If you're here, you're probably a beginner in the world of code, right? I bet you've done a lot of research, but now you want to know more about software development! That is great! But first, let me explain what programming is to begin with.<br></a>
        <br>
        <a class = 'title1'>What is Software Development?</a><br>
        <br>
        <a class = 'subtitle'>Software Development</a> is the activity of creating computer programs performed by a developer or group of developers.
        This work is very important because thanks to software development, hundreds of people are improving their quality of life.
        A very simple example of this is the fact that today, anyone with access to the Internet and a bank account no longer needs to
        leave the house to go shopping or pay their bills.<br>
        <br>
        Almost everything can be bought and paid for over the Internet, using software created for these purposes, avoiding waiting in
        queues at the bank, the stress of traffic, in addition to spending on fuel or transportation, so that the time saved can be used
        to dedicate yourself to other activities. things.<br>
        <br>
        And even those who do not have access to the Internet or a bank account benefit from the use of software through the companies that
        need them to provide their services, such as banks, telephone companies, supermarkets, etc.
