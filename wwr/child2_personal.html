          <a class = 'title1'>How Does Programming Help the World and Help Me Get a Good Job?<br></a>
            <br>
            <a class = 'hint'>On this page you will find some platforms where you can research and update yourself on the job market situation for the area you want, 
            whether being a back-end or front-end programmer, dealing with python or java. These tools help us to better see the future and opportunities. Here's a short text about what codes mean to the world and can mean to your career.</a>
            <br>
            <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Growing Market, High Salaries</a><br>
            The IT market is huge, it is in constant growth, however, there are few qualified professionals. Data from the Brazilian Association of IT
            Companies (Brasscom) reveal that the area should create 420,000 new jobs by 2024, but it is estimated that, by then, 150,000 jobs will remain unfilled.
            This means that there is a considerable deficit of professionals, which is not being filled by educational institutions. Salary is another great attraction
            for pursuing a career in this profession.<br>
            <br>
            For 2020, the salary range in Brazil is between R$ 4 and R$ 15 thousand (per month), depending on the professional's level of knowledge and location, according
            to a survey carried out by Geekhunter, a platform for vacancies for programmers.
            <br>
            <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Programming is Everywhere<br></a>
            The digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic meant that many companies had to adapt their business models to online as an alternative to get through
            this crisis with less impact. This market strategy only increased the need for programming professionals. The programmer's work is in many places, such as websites, 
            e-commerce, applications, games and online classes. For the development of all these technologies, there is a professional involved and qualified, who dedicated hours writing codes!
            <br>
            <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Development of Interpersonal Skills<br></a>
            The area requires the development of many interpersonal skills. Some that I believe are the most impactful are how to solve problems, communication and teamwork, and lastly, perseverance.
            <br>
            <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Solving Problems</a> - Often, when you are 'coding', it is necessary to break the problem into small problems, in addition to using a lot of logic and knowing how to prioritize what is most
            important. These skills help develop structured thinking and a new perspective on how to solve problems for professionals in this segment.
            <br>
            <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Communication and Teamwork</a> - Another important area that programming can help with is in developing communication and teamwork skills. In the day-to-day work, the dev 
            will not be alone, as deliveries are usually made with a large team behind them.
            <br>
            <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Perseverance</a> - Lastly, programming can help develop perseverance. To do a project, you will often encounter difficulties, hundreds of 'bugs' and obstacles. Overcoming
            this every day will definitely help you refine your ability to persist.
            <br>
            All these practices will be transferred to your knowledge repertoire and may even help you with other situations in your daily life.

        <a class = 'title1'>LinkedIn</a>
        <br><a class="link" href="url">http://www.linkedin.com/<br></a>
        <p class="paragraph1"> LinkedIn is a platform that mixes characteristics of a social network, a job site and an online resume. It is one of the most popular options for
        those who want to maintain a visible professional profile and expand their network of contacts. Job offers, however, are still smaller than traditional sites. Offers a subscription 
        service, which expands contact possibilities and gives greater visibility of your resume to contractors.</p>  
        <a class = 'title1'>Indeed.com</a>
        <br><a class="link" href="url">http://www.indeed.com.br/<br></a>
        <p class="paragraph1">Indeed is a job aggregator, that is: it is a tool capable of searching for jobs for
        the requested profile on different job sites at the same time. It is completely free for applicants.</p>
        <a class = 'title1'>VanHack</a>
        <br><a class="link" href="url">https://vanhack.com/<br></a>
        <p class="paragraph1">The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the
        funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying
        to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>
