        <br>
        <a class = 'title1'>What is Software Development?</a><br>
        <br>
        <a class = 'subtitle'>Software Development</a> is the activity of creating computer programs performed by a developer or group of developers.
        This work is very important because thanks to software development, hundreds of people are improving their quality of life.
        A very simple example of this is the fact that today, anyone with access to the Internet and a bank account no longer needs to
        leave the house to go shopping or pay their bills.<br>
        <br>
        Almost everything can be bought and paid for over the Internet, using software created for these purposes, avoiding waiting in
        queues at the bank, the stress of traffic, in addition to spending on fuel or transportation, so that the time saved can be used
        to dedicate yourself to other activities. things.<br>
        <br>
        And even those who do not have access to the Internet or a bank account benefit from the use of software through the companies that
        need them to provide their services, such as banks, telephone companies, supermarkets, etc.

      <h3>Study</h3>
    <p id="paragraph">
        <a class = 'title1'>How Can I Study Codes?<br></a>
        <br>
        <a class = 'hint'>Here you will have access to some important sites and materials for your studies. But first you need to understand how to study properly.</a>
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Start at The Beginning<br></a>
        
        To start in the area of Information Technology, mainly in web or desktop development, it is necessary to learn Programming Logic and Object Oriented Logic. These two points
        are the foundation for anyone who wants to be a programmer, no matter which path you want to follow later. The purpose of this knowledge is to increase your logical reasoning
        to make you able to find the best resolution for future problems, which will need to be solved through technology.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Choose a Goal<br></a>
        
        After familiarizing yourself with the basics of programming, find a focus. Start by understanding the difference between Front-end and Back-end. Choose a goal and run after
        courses and articles focused on your purpose.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Practice (A LOT!)<br></a>
        
        It may sound cliché, but practice makes perfect and programming is no different. The more you practice, the more your brain will be trained to solve and/or avoid problems.
        You know that uncle who needs a website for his neighborhood store? Offer your work. In this way, you will put your experience into practice and, in addition, you will have
        a nice portfolio to present to your future clients.
        <br>
        Finally, don't get discouraged. Learning something new can be challenging, but in the end you can be sure it will be rewarding.

      <h3>Codes and Job Market</h3>
    <p id="paragraph">
    <a class = 'title1'>How Does Programming Help the World and Help Me Get a Good Job?<br></a>
        <br>
        <a class = 'hint'>On this page you will find some platforms where you can research and update yourself on the job market situation for the area you want, 
            whether being a back-end or front-end programmer, dealing with python or java. These tools help us to better see the future and opportunities. Here's a short text about what codes mean to the world and can mean to your career.</a>
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Growing Market, High Salaries</a><br>
        The IT market is huge, it is in constant growth, however, there are few qualified professionals. Data from the Brazilian Association of IT
        Companies (Brasscom) reveal that the area should create 420,000 new jobs by 2024, but it is estimated that, by then, 150,000 jobs will remain unfilled.
        This means that there is a considerable deficit of professionals, which is not being filled by educational institutions. Salary is another great attraction
        for pursuing a career in this profession.<br>
        <br>
        For 2020, the salary range in Brazil is between R$ 4 and R$ 15 thousand (per month), depending on the professional's level of knowledge and location, according
        to a survey carried out by Geekhunter, a platform for vacancies for programmers.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Programming is Everywhere<br></a>
        The digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic meant that many companies had to adapt their business models to online as an alternative to get through
        this crisis with less impact. This market strategy only increased the need for programming professionals. The programmer's work is in many places, such as websites, 
        e-commerce, applications, games and online classes. For the development of all these technologies, there is a professional involved and qualified, who dedicated hours writing codes!
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Development of Interpersonal Skills<br></a>
        The area requires the development of many interpersonal skills. Some that I believe are the most impactful are how to solve problems, communication and teamwork, and lastly, perseverance.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Solving Problems</a> - Often, when you are 'coding', it is necessary to break the problem into small problems, in addition to using a lot of logic and knowing how to prioritize what is most
        important. These skills help develop structured thinking and a new perspective on how to solve problems for professionals in this segment.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Communication and Teamwork</a> - Another important area that programming can help with is in developing communication and teamwork skills. In the day-to-day work, the dev 
        will not be alone, as deliveries are usually made with a large team behind them.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Perseverance</a> - Lastly, programming can help develop perseverance. To do a project, you will often encounter difficulties, hundreds of 'bugs' and obstacles. Overcoming
        this every day will definitely help you refine your ability to persist.
        <br>
        All these practices will be transferred to your knowledge repertoire and may even help you with other situations in your daily life.

            service, which expands contact possibilities and gives greater visibility of your resume to contractors.</p>

            to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>
