        <a class = 'title1'>How Can I Study Codes?<br></a>
        <div id="paragraph_study">
        <a class = 'hint'>Here you will have access to some important sites and materials for your studies. But first you need to understand how to study properly.</a>
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Start at The Beginning<br></a>

        To start in the area of Information Technology, mainly in web or desktop development, it is necessary to learn Programming Logic and Object Oriented Logic. These two points
        are the foundation for anyone who wants to be a programmer, no matter which path you want to follow later. The purpose of this knowledge is to increase your logical reasoning
        to make you able to find the best resolution for future problems, which will need to be solved through technology.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Choose a Goal<br></a>
        
        After familiarizing yourself with the basics of programming, find a focus. Start by understanding the difference between Front-end and Back-end. Choose a goal and run after
        courses and articles focused on your purpose.
        <br>
        <br><a class = 'subtitle'>Practice (A LOT!)<br></a>
        
        It may sound clich√©, but practice makes perfect and programming is no different. The more you practice, the more your brain will be trained to solve and/or avoid problems.
        You know that uncle who needs a website for his neighborhood store? Offer your work. In this way, you will put your experience into practice and, in addition, you will have
        a nice portfolio to present to your future clients.
        <br>
        Finally, don't get discouraged. Learning something new can be challenging, but in the end you can be sure it will be rewarding.

            <p class="paragraph1"> GPT Chat is basically an algorithm based on artificial intelligence. The chosen name is an acronym for ‚ÄúGenerative Pre-Trained Transformer‚Äù. For me GPT is an excellent tool and can be more accurate than google in some cases!</p>
